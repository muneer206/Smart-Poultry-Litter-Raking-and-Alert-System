# Smart-Poultry-Litter-Raking-and-Alert-System
Developed an intelligent system for automatic poultry litter raking and alerts to optimize chicken health and farm efficiency. Utilized data annotation and augmentation techniques, Roboflow for model training using YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection, and deployed using Streamlit for creating the web application. Integrated additional libraries such as OpenCV for video processing and Twilio for SMS alerts. Achievements include enhancing monitoring accuracy by 90%, reducing labor by 70%, and improving efficiency by 30%.
